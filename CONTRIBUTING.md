# Contributing Guidelines

## Suggested Workflow/Tips:
### Development
1. FORK the main branch of [https://github.com/Paul-Austin-Oswego-CSC480-HCI521/OZ-CSC-480-HCI-521-Spring-2024](https://github.com/Paul-Austin-Oswego-CSC480-HCI521/OZ-CSC-480-HCI-521-Spring-2024), making sure that "Copy the main branch only" is NOT checked if you want to be able to develop within your team branch as well as the main branch 
2. DEVELOP within your fork (pull OR push access with no need for approval in order to merge)
2. SHARE WITH YOUR TEAM by making a Pull Request within your team's branch (approval from at least one team member required in order to be merged)
3. SHARE WITH ORGANIZATION/CLASS by making a Pull Request within the main branch (approval from the Triage team required in order to be merged)

### Triage
* When another member of your team makes a Pull Request into your team's branch, you may approve the Pull Request if it is of sufficient quality, allowing it to be merged into your team's branch. Alternatively, if there are issues, you may request changes, or simply leave a comment.

## Information on Branches:
### Main Branch:

* When making a Pull Request to the 'main' branch of the repository, approval from either @Phantasmogenesis or a member of the QA team is required in order for the PR to be merged.

* TO DO: ~~ The main branch runs CI/CD (tests, lints, deployment) through GitHub Actions for each Pull Request. ~~

### Team Branches:
* When making a Pull Request to a particular team's branch of the repository, approval from at least one other member of that team is required in order for the PR to be merged.

* ~~ Team branches do NOT run CI/CD (tests, lints, deployment) on each Pull Request. ~~
